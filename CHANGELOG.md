## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-12
### Added
- Added `base_interface.py` module as an abstract definition of the Python-Spectre interface.
- Introduced the `Session` type to the interface to manage Spectre sessions, simplifying the PySpectre API and enabling object-oriented programming while maintaining the functional interface.
- Added `dummy_interface.py` to implement a dummy interface for software testing, eliminating the need for Cadence Spectre.
- Added `spectre_interface.py` to implement the actual interface to Cadence Spectre.

### Changed
- Moved `config.yaml` to the repositoryâ€™s top-level directory.
- Added error handling, comments, and print statements to `example_1.py` and `example_2.py`.
- Renamed `core.py` to `functional.py`.

### Fixed
- Replaced single quotes with double quotes for consistency.
- Improved type handling and annotations using the `mypy` type checker.

## [0.0.3] - 2024-11-11
### Fixed
- Adding default Spectre arguments to Spectre call in function `setup_command` in `core.py` when no config file is specified.

- Added implementation for interactive command `sclListParameter (sclGetCircuit "")`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclListParameter (sclGetAnalysis "{analysis_name}")`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclListAttribute (sclGetParameter (sclGetAnalysis "{analysis_name}") "{parameter_name}")`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclSetAttribute (sclGetParameter (sclGetAnalysis "{analysis_name}") "{parameter_name}") "{attribute_name}" "{value}"`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclCreateAnalysis "{analysis_name}" "{analysis_type}"`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclListAttribute (sclGetParameter (sclGetCircuit "") "{circuit_parameter}")`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclSetAttribute (sclGetParameter (sclGetCircuit "") "{circuit_parameter}") "{attribute_name}" "{value}"`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclListParameter (sclGetInstance "{instance_name}")`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclListAttribute (sclGetParameter (sclGetInstance "{instance_name}") "{instance_parameter}")`
- Added implementation for interactive command `sclSetAttribute (sclGetParameter (sclGetInstance "{instance_name}") "{instance_parameter}") "{attribute_name}" "{value}"`
- Added Jupyter notebook for demonstration of interactive interface
- Added docstrings in numpydoc format
- Added configuration file
- Added CHANGELOG file
